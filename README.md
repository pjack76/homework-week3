this code generates random password with lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters.

lowercase letters are set to default in the sense that if upper case, numbers, and special characters are not needed, the password would be generated entirely of lowercase letters.

i can stop uppercase, numbers, and special characters from appearing in the password, but i cannot ensure that at least 1 of any of the 4 types of characters appear in the password even if they are selected.

the list of special characters in the code are the ones i selected.  characters can be added or removed from the list as desired.

the good news is that the code spits out the correct length.

the longer the length the more chance at least one of the desired type of character would appear in the password.

do long password or generated the password a few times to get the desired result.
